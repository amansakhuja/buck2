    {param title: 'Buck Daemon (buckd)' /}
    {param navid: 'command_buckd' /}
    {param description}
      A command that starts a buck daemon process that the client will talk to.
    {/param}
    {param content}

<p>
The first time that you run a Buck command, Buck starts a daemon process
for the current project in the current working directory. For subsequent
commands, Buck checks for the running daemon process and if found,
uses the daemon to execute the command. Using the Buck daemon can save
significant time as it avoids the overhead of starting a Java virtual
machine (JVM) and loading the Buck class files. It also enables Buck to
take advantage of caches for build-file parsing, and for Buck's target
graph and action graph.
</p>

<p>
The Buck daemon writes its port, process id, and log output to files in
a <code>.buckd</code>{sp} directory that the daemon creates in the
project root directory.  Subsequent Buck commands use these files to 
find the daemon process, and a new Buck daemon process will use
them to kill any already-existing daemon process.
</p>

<p>
It is safe to run multiple Buck daemons started from different project
directories as they do not interfere with each other, 
making <code>buckd</code> suitable for use in shared-server environments 
or where several projects are being worked on concurrently.
</p>

<p>
While it runs, the Buck daemon process monitors the project's file
system and invalidates cached build rules if any build input files
change. The Buck daemon excludes from monitoring any subtrees of the 
project file system that are specified in
the {call buckconfig.project_ignore /} setting
of <code>.buckconfig</code>. By adding project-specific output 
directories and source-control directories, such as<code>.git</code>, to 
this setting, you can significantly improve performance; this might be necessary
to avoid file-change overflows when using Buck daemons to build large
projects.
</p>

<p>
By default, Buck daemon processes ignore changes to temporary files
created by text editors.
</p>

<h4>Killing or disabling the Buck daemon</h4>
<p>
The Buck daemon process is killed if
<ul>
<li>
  the Buck configuration changes&mdash;unless that change is to a setting that is whitelisted 
  by <code>IGNORE_FIELDS_FOR_DAEMON_RESTART</code> in <a href="https://github.com/facebook/buck/blob/master/src/com/facebook/buck/core/config/BuckConfig.java"><code>BuckConfig.java</code></a>.
</li>
<li>the <code>buck clean</code> command is run.</li>
<li>the <code>.buckd</code> directory in the project root directory is deleted.</li>
<li>the daemon has been idle for 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can also kill the Buck daemon explicitly by running <code>buck kill</code> in 
the directory tree for your project. Note that if&mdash;for some
reason&mdash;multiple instances of the daemon are running, 
the <code>buck kill</code> command kills only one of them.
</p>

<p>
<em>If the daemon is killed, you might experience a significant delay
the next time that you invoke a Buck command as the daemon
restarts.</em>
</p>

<p>
To disable the daemon and prevent it from starting, set the environment 
variable {sp}<code>NO_BUCKD</code> to <code>1</code>. For example:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
{literal}
NO_BUCKD=1
buck build project_name
{/literal}
</pre>
</p>


<h4>Note about Buck configuration changes</h4>
<p>
A Buck configuration change that kills the Buck daemon can be caused <em>not only by</em> explicitly 
changing a setting in <code>.buckconfig</code> or <code>.buckconfig.local</code>, but also by using 
the <code>--config</code>, <code>--flagfile</code>, or <code>--config-file</code> {call buck.cmd_link}{param name: 'common_parameters' /}{param rendered_text: ' command-line parameters' /}{/call}.
