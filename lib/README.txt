emma-2.0.5312.jar was taken from http://emma.sourceforge.net/. 

The version is not the latest but the latest version is in a folder called emma_testing 
which might be an unstable version. Also the new version's main feature is to be able 
to recover code coverage data from a JVM without the JVM exiting. This is not a 
critical feature that we need for our purposes. For download go to:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/emma/emma-release/2.0.5312/emma-2.0.5312-lib.zip
