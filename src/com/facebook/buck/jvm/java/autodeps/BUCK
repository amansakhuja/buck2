    # under testdata/ than it is to  construct one programmatically, it makes

    # than a conventional unit test. Since the integration test framework is generally
    # driven by running a Buck subcommand, it makes sense for AutodepsCommandIntegrationTest
    # to be responsible for verifying JavaDepsFinder.
