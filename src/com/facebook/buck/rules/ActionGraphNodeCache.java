/**
 * Cache for action graph subgraphs associated with particular target graph nodes, used to enable
 * incremental action graph construction.
 *
 * <p>This class tracks target graph nodes and their associated build rule subgraphs. Whenever we
 * start a new target graph walk, we invalidate parts of the cache that are stale. During the target
 * graph walk {@see ActionGraphCache#createActionGraphSerially}, if we find a target graph node that
 * is in the cache, we grab the build rules that target node generated last time, and splice them
 * into the new action graph, without traversing further down in the target graph. Once we've
 * completed the walk, we make sure to update the {@link BuildRuleResolver}s any of the build rules
 * might be hanging on to to prevent leaking the previous action graph.
